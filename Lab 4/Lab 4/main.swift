//
// main.swift
//
// I will be using my own main.swift to test your code.
// The assignment only requires you to submit the Task.swift and TaskList.swift; however, you are
// encouraged to develop your own main which exercises the methods of all classes.
//
// When the project is graded we will swap in our own main to test the robustness of your classes.
//
// Behind the scenes you are welcome to implement additional methods and classes to support both of these classes.
// However, these internal workings should not be exposed to the outside world â€”meaning that the user of this class
// should never have to call anything other than the methods listed above, as such they should only appear in
// the .swift files.
