## Rules ##
The rules for the game of Pig are rather simple. Here is a video.
The following description defines the rules of the game:
* Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player’s turn, the player is faced with two options:
    * roll — If the player rolls a
        - 1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the next player’s turn.
        - 2–6: the number is added to the player’s turn total and the player’s turn continues.
    * hold — The turn total is added to the player’s score and it becomes the next player’s turn.
       
* The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
* Players must alternate turns going first between games.
